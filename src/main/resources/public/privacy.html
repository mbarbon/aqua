    </p>

    <h2>Analytics:</h2>

    <p>

      I collect anonymous usage statistics for the Aqua website and application, primarily as a learning experience for me in how
      to collect and analyze this data in an useful way, and also to get insights on how they are used and how they can be
      improved. This information is not linked to your MAL account (if you chose to enter it).

    </p>

    <h2>Crash reporting:</h2>

    <p>

      I collect anonymous crash and malfunction information for the Aqua Mobile application using
      <a href="http://fabric.io/">Fabric's Crashlytics</a>. The data is used to correct issues, and to improve the application.
